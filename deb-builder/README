To create a deb of Tangaza, you need to run make-tangaza-deb.sh
The following variables have to be correctly set BEFORE you run it.
They should point to the location of the local Tangaza and Common 
git repositories.

 - TANGAZA_SCRIPTS=/path/to/git/Tangaza
 - COMMON_SCRIPTS=/path/to/git/Common

The generated deb file will be saved in "install/tangaza-1.0.deb". 
You should then run install/install.sh to install tangaza-1.0.deb.
